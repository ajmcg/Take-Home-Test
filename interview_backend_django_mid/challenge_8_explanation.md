## Steps to Accomplish the Task
 
 
### 1. Define the Metadata Schema
First, we need to define a schema for the metadata using Pydantic. This schema will ensure that the data is validated before it is saved.
 
** `schemas.py`**
 
- Create a class `InventoryMetaData` with the specified fields.
- The `year` field should be an integer.
- The `actors` field should be a list of strings.
- The `imdb_rating` field should be a decimal.
- The `rotten_tomatoes_rating` field should be an integer.
- The `film_locations` field should be a list of strings.
 
### 2. Update the Inventory Model
Ensure that the Inventory model has a `metadata` field that can store JSON data.
 
** `models.py`**
 
- Add a `metadata` field of type `models.JSONField()` to the `Inventory` class if it isn't already present.
 
### 3. Create the Serializer
Create a serializer to handle the serialization and deserialization of Inventory objects, including the metadata.
 
** `serializers.py`**
 
- Ensure the `InventorySerializer` includes the `metadata` field.
- Ensure the serializer correctly handles nested relationships (e.g., `tags`, `inventory`, and `language`).
 
### 4. Create the View
Create a view to handle the creation of new Inventory items.
 
** `views.py`**
 
- Create a class-based view `InventoryListCreateView` using `APIView`.
- Implement a `post` method to handle creating new Inventory items.
- Validate the `metadata` field using the `InventoryMetaData` schema.
- If validation fails, return an error response.
- If validation passes, save the new Inventory item.
 
### 5. Update URLs
Ensure the URLs are configured to include the new view.
 
** `urls.py`**
 
- Add a new URL pattern for the `InventoryListCreateView` to handle POST requests for creating new inventory items.
- Ensure the URL configuration is updated to route to the correct view.
 
### 6. Test the API
Finally, test the API to ensure it is working as expected. You can use tools like Postman or curl to send requests to the API.
 
#### Example JSON Payload:
- Use the following JSON structure when sending a POST request to create a new inventory item:
    ```json
    {
        "type": 1,
        "language": 1,
        "tags": [1, 2],
        "metadata": {
            "year": 2023,
            "actors": ["Actor 1", "Actor 2"],
            "imdb_rating": 7.5,
            "rotten_tomatoes_rating": 85,
            "film_locations": ["Location 1", "Location 2"]
        },
        "is_active": true
    }
    ```
 
Following these steps should help you add an item to the Inventory through the API while ensuring that the metadata includes the specified fields.
